# MRNET-for-Knee-Diagnosis


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is the preferred method for diagnosing knee
injuries. However, interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and subject to diagnostic error
and variability. An automated system for interpreting knee MRI could prioritize high risk
patients and assist clinicians in making diagnoses. Deep learning methods, in being able to
automatically learn layers of features, are well suited for modeling the complex relationships
between medical images and their interpretations. In this study we developed a deep
learning model for detecting general abnormalities and specific diagnoses (anterior cruciate
ligament [ACL] tears and meniscal tears) on knee MRI exams.
